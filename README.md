# WorkingWithPython

**WorkingWithPython** 
is a Python project developed by Nurdin to demonstrate various programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, 
exception handling, and basic arithmetic operations. This project is organized into several Python files, each focused on specific topics to help users 
understand and practice Python programming essentials.

## Project Structure

- **AreaOfRectangle.py** - Calculates the area of a rectangle based on user input.
- **Arrays.py** - Demonstrates array operations in Python.
- **Assignment.py** - Contains examples of assignment operations and variable management.
- **BreakContinue.py** - Shows the usage of `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- **ControlStatement.py** - Covers conditional statements and control flow.
- **DataStructures.py** - Introduces basic data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **DataType.py** - Explores different data types and type conversions.
- **ExceptionHandling.py** - Illustrates exception handling in Python.
- **Functions.py** - Contains examples of function definitions, parameters, and return values.
- **Inheritance.py** - Demonstrates inheritance concepts in object-oriented programming.
- **Introduction.py** - A basic introduction to Python, including printing and simple syntax.
- **Loops.py** - Shows examples of `for` and `while` loops.
- **MathModule.py** - Utilizes Pythonâ€™s math module for various mathematical operations.
- **Module.py** - Explains how to use and create Python modules.
- **OOP1.py & OOP2.py** - Covers fundamental object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Operators.py** - Demonstrates arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators.
- **Polymorphism.py** - An example of polymorphism in OOP.
- **SimpleCalculator.py** - A simple calculator implementation allowing basic arithmetic operations.
- **String.py** - Explores string manipulation and operations.
- **Students.py** - Manages student records or showcases data handling in classes.
- **UsersInputAndOutput.py** - Demonstrates user input and output operations.
- **Variables.py** - Contains examples of variable declaration, types, and scope.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noordinofficial/workingwithpython.git

**2.Navigate into the project directory**
    cd workingwithpython

**3.(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment**
   python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate **On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`**
**Install dependencies (if any)**
   pip install -r requirements.txt

**4.Usage**

Run each script individually to see different programming concepts in action. For example, to run the SimpleCalculator.py file:
python SimpleCalculator.py
Each file is self-contained, allowing you to focus on specific topics without dependencies.
